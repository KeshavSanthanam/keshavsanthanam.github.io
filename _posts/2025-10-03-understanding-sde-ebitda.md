Key differences that matter when evaluating sub-$5M businesses:

## Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE)
- Adds back owner's salary and benefits to EBITDA
- Assumes single owner-operator model
- More relevant for businesses <$2M EBITDA
- Common add-backs: owner compensation, personal expenses run through business, one-time expenses
- Typical multiples: 2-4x SDE depending on industry and growth

## When SDE Makes More Sense
- Single-location service businesses (HVAC, landscaping, medical practices)
- Owner is deeply involved in daily operations
- Compensation structure not clearly separated from profits
- Business requires owner expertise to maintain margins

## EBITDA-Based Valuation Threshold
- Generally more appropriate above $2M in earnings
- Assumes professional management team in place
- Seller can step away without operational disruption
- Multiple expansion: 4-7x EBITDA for established businesses

## Practical Implications for Search
- Don't compare SDE multiples to EBITDA multiples directly
- A business at 3.5x SDE might be equivalent to 6-7x EBITDA
- Need to normalize for owner replacement cost
- Factor in $80K-150K for hiring general manager if buying SDE-valued business

## Red Flags I'm Learning to Spot
- SDE calculations that add back "theoretical" expenses
- Owners claiming they barely work (if true, why SDE valuation?)
- Aggressive add-backs for family members who actually work there
- Comparing their 2.5x SDE ask to a 5x EBITDA comp—different metrics entirely
