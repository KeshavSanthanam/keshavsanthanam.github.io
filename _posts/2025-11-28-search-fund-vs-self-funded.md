Weighing the traditional search fund model against self-funded search:

## Traditional Search Fund Model

**Structure**
- Raise $400-600K in search capital from 15-25 investors
- 12-24 month search timeline with salary support ($80-120K/year)
- Investors get equity (typically 30-40% post-search dilution)
- Same investors fund the acquisition (or facilitate bank financing)
- Ongoing board involvement and governance

**Advantages**
- Salary during search = can search full-time without burning personal savings
- Built-in acquisition capital sources
- Experienced investor group (pattern recognition, rolodex, advice)
- Aligned incentives: investors want you to find a good deal
- Track record: search funds have 30+ years of data, ~70% find and close deals

**Disadvantages**
- 30-40% equity dilution before you even buy a business
- Board oversight = less autonomy in decision-making
- Pressure to deploy capital within search timeline
- Need to fundraise before you search (itself a 3-6 month process)
- Investor consensus required on acquisition target

## Self-Funded Search

**Structure**
- Search on your own time/dime (nights/weekends or savings)
- No external search capital = no search period dilution
- Flexibility on timeline and target criteria
- Raise acquisition capital deal-by-deal (SBA, investors, earn-outs)

**Advantages**
- Keep 20-30% more equity (no search fund dilution)
- Total flexibility: search timeline, industry focus, deal size
- No board or investor consensus needed during search
- Can maintain day job during search (though slower)
- Only fundraise once you have a compelling deal

**Disadvantages**
- Burning personal savings or searching part-time (much slower)
- Acquisition financing harder without committed capital partners
- No experienced investor group pressure-testing your thinking
- Easier to pursue mediocre deal due to sunk cost fallacy
- Lonelier process—no built-in peer group

## What I'm Seeing in the Data

**Traditional Search Fund Returns (2000-2020)**
- ~70% of funds find and acquire a business
- Median IRR ~33% for acquired companies
- ~30% of deals result in losses or mediocre returns
- Top quartile returns > 50% IRR

**Self-Funded Search Outcomes**
- Less data (selection bias: failures less visible)
- Higher variance in outcomes
- More flexibility leads to both home runs and disasters
- Acquisition success rate appears lower (~50%?) but hard to measure

## My Personal Calculus

**Leaning Self-Funded Because:**
- Want to maintain flexibility on timeline (could take 2-3 years)
- Not ready to commit to 12-month full-time search
- Prefer keeping equity vs having structured support
- Current job provides optionality to search part-time
- Comfortable with uncertainty and less structure

**Search Fund Advantages I'll Miss:**
- Pattern recognition from experienced investors
- Forcing function of search timeline
- Built-in acquisition capital
- Network and industry connections
- Peer group of other searchers

## Hybrid Approach I'm Considering

**Phase 1: Self-Funded Exploration (6-12 months)**
- Search nights/weekends while employed
- Build industry knowledge, network, deal flow
- If I find compelling opportunity → raise acquisition capital around specific deal

**Phase 2: Decision Point**
- If search is promising but need full-time focus → raise search fund then
- If found deal → pursue with SBA + individual investors
- If not gaining traction → reevaluate or pause

## Key Insight
Traditional search fund makes sense if you:
- Can afford 3-6 month fundraise + 12-24 month search without income gap
- Value structure, mentorship, pattern recognition > equity
- Want to search full-time and have financial runway

Self-funded makes sense if you:
- Have income source during search (job, savings, spouse)
- Prioritize flexibility and equity over structure
- Comfortable with ambiguity and longer timeline
- Have network to source acquisition capital deal-by-deal

I'm starting self-funded with option to raise search fund if the right opportunity emerges.
