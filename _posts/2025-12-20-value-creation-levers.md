Where does the value come from post-acquisition? Mapping realistic improvement opportunities:

## Revenue Growth (Highest Potential, Hardest to Execute)

**Low-Hanging Fruit**
- Pricing increases (3-5% annually often feasible if not done historically)
- Upselling existing customers (expand wallet share)
- Reactivating churned customers (win-back campaigns)
- Geographic expansion within existing model

**Higher Effort**
- New product/service offerings adjacent to core
- New customer segments (if replicable go-to-market)
- M&A/tuck-ins (buy competitors or complementary businesses)

**Realistic Expectations**
- Organic growth >10% annually is aggressive for stable small business
- Most value creation in SMB comes from margin improvement + multiple expansion, not revenue growth
- Chasing growth can destroy value if it requires margin sacrifice

## Margin Improvement (Most Reliable Value Creation)

**COGS/Direct Cost Reduction**
- Vendor renegotiation (consolidate suppliers, volume discounts)
- Waste reduction in manufacturing/service delivery
- Labor efficiency (process improvement, better scheduling)
- Shrinkage/theft reduction (surprising how common in SMBs)

**Operating Expense Optimization**
- Technology/software consolidation (SMBs often have redundant tools)
- Facilities optimization (renegotiate lease, right-size space)
- Insurance/benefits shopping (rarely optimized in small businesses)
- Marketing spend efficiency (cut what doesn't work, double down on what does)

**Realistic Targets**
- 2-5% EBITDA margin improvement in first 2 years is achievable
- Beyond that, diminishing returns without revenue growth or major changes

## Working Capital Efficiency

**Quick Wins**
- Accounts receivable: tighten credit terms, faster invoicing, collections process
- Inventory: reduce safety stock, improve turnover, eliminate obsolete SKUs
- Accounts payable: extend terms (without damaging vendor relationships)

**Impact**
- Freeing up $50-100K in working capital in first year is common
- One-time cash benefit, but meaningful for debt paydown or reinvestment

## Operational Improvements

**Process Standardization**
- Document tribal knowledge
- Reduce key person dependency
- Implement basic SOP for critical functions
- Cross-training to reduce single points of failure

**Technology Enablement**
- CRM for sales (if not already in place)
- Basic automation for invoicing, collections, scheduling
- Financial reporting and dashboards
- Not about fancy tech—just bringing SMB to baseline modern practices

**Benefits**
- Reduced owner time required (higher quality of life and sellable at higher multiple later)
- Scalability: can grow without proportional overhead increase
- Reduced risk: less dependent on any one person

## Multiple Expansion (The Real Prize)

**From SDE to EBITDA Business**
- Hire general manager, step back from day-to-day
- Business valued on EBITDA (higher multiple) vs SDE
- Example: $500K SDE at 3x = $1.5M value → $400K EBITDA at 5.5x = $2.2M value
- Net gain: $700K despite lower earnings (due to GM salary)

**Quality Improvements That Drive Multiple**
- Customer diversification (reduce concentration risk)
- Recurring revenue vs project-based
- Documented processes and systems
- Professional management team
- Growth trajectory

## My Mental Model for Value Creation

**Year 1: Stabilize + Quick Wins**
- No revenue loss during transition
- 2-3% margin improvement (vendor renegotiation, waste reduction)
- Working capital optimization
- Target: 15-20% value creation through operational improvement

**Years 2-3: Growth + Professionalization**
- 5-7% revenue growth (pricing + volume)
- Hire key roles (GM, sales lead, ops manager)
- Additional 2-3% margin improvement
- Technology and process improvements
- Target: 30-40% cumulative value creation

**Years 3-5: Scale + Multiple Expansion**
- M&A/tuck-ins if capital available
- Transition from SDE to EBITDA business
- Position for sale at higher multiple
- Target: 2-3x return on invested capital

## Realistic Outcomes (Based on Search Fund Data)

**Base Case (50th Percentile)**
- 5-7% annual revenue growth
- 3-5% cumulative margin improvement
- Some multiple expansion due to professionalization
- 2.0-2.5x MOIC (multiple on invested capital) in 5-7 years

**Good Case (75th Percentile)**
- 8-10% annual revenue growth
- 5-8% cumulative margin improvement
- Meaningful multiple expansion (SDE → EBITDA basis)
- 3-4x MOIC in 5-7 years

**Home Run (90th Percentile)**
- >12% annual growth through market share gains or M&A
- Significant operational transformation
- Multiple expansion + industry tailwinds
- >5x MOIC in 5-7 years

## Key Insight

Don't need to reinvent the business to create value. Bringing professional management, basic systems, and operational discipline to a ~$2M EBITDA business that's been owner-operated for 20 years can create 40-50% value in first 3 years. That + modest growth + multiple expansion = attractive returns without heroics.
