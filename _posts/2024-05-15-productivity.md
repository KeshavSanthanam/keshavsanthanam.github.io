## Introduction

When we are more productive, we accomplish more in less time, meaning we can adjust our goals upward and stay ahead of deadlines. This has positive effects on goal-setting and stress management. 

Listed below are some productivity strategies with an emphasis on ones I feel are rarely discussed or surprisingly effective. **I have done many but not all of these.**

**My general theory of short-term decision making is based on friction.** Individuals usually set long-term goals just fine, but we divert from them when it is convenient to pursue more rewarding short-term goals, even if we know we shouldn't. That's why these strategies all broadly increase executive functioning (i.e. napping) or make it harder to make bad short-term decisions (i.e. blocking). 

## Do I need to use these techniques?

No. I find the ones I have used useful and that's due to who I am as an individual (easily distracted, avoids low-stimulation activities, bad at managing the time I fall sleep (relevant for the napping advice)). Nevertheless, I'm sure at least a few of these are broadly useful.

## Ordered most to least helpful by my estimations...

### "Napping" (or, alternatively, napping)
- "Napping" = lying down in bed with my eyes closed and lights off as if sleeping but usually for too short of a time to sleep (I can take a while)
	- In my experience, this has a >50% chance of improving my short-term (next 30 min to 2 hrs) performance, including when sleep deprived
	- Aim to rest longer when more sleep deprived
	- My current theory is that the best strategy is short naps very frequently (i.e. 3 min every hour), but this does require more self-discipline and hasn't been tested much by me or anyone else I know of
- Comfortable lengths: **very individual-dependent** (but for me... 3-25 min, 40-60 min)
- NOTE: health risks
	- All sources I have seen have not controlled for other variables; also, the action of napping without sleeping is similar physiologically to meditation, which is well-practiced and does not seem to have adverse physical health risks. it seems like the main takeaway is that if you have chronic fatigue, napping is not a cure. here are some examples of the correlation of napping with negative health risks if you care:

		- [AHA Article](https://newsroom.heart.org/news/study-shows-link-between-frequent-naps-and-high-blood-pressure)

### Changes to your phone
- Blocking (much easier to do on Android, doable on iOS with the help of iOS parental controls (I don't know much about iOS options otherwise))
	- Soft blocking = increasing the friction to navigate to distractions while not making it impossible
		- AppLock [Android]
			- locks apps with passwords (making them longer makes this more effective)
			- [Preferred](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gamemalt.applocker)
			- [Also great](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sp.protector.free)
		- Auto App Off [Android]
			- closes apps after a certain amount of time
			- **very powerful when used with AppLock**
			- [Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aozora_create.appofftimer&hl=en_US&gl=US)
		- Placing a phone out of reach/in another room
	- ‚ö†Ô∏èHard blocking = fully (or close enough to fully) preventing you from navigating to distractions
		- (Android) Google Family Link
			- Can block sites, apps, and more
			- Can be implemented by having a friend hold onto the master password
		- Lockbox
			- Physically removing yourself from your phone for a period of time (timed lockboxes available on Amazon - **choose one that is difficult to break**)
	- Replacing social media/web browsing with another form of the same information
		- RSS Feeds
			- Use RSS readers to read your favorite blog content to help replace/mitigate social media usage (the idea is to gradually shift towards longer-form content)
   			- This strategy works best if you have a large overlap between favorite bloggers and favorite Twitter users, for example
			- I suggest feeder.co (browser) and Feeder (Android)
- ‚ö†Ô∏èDo not disturb/limiting notifications
	- I like to respond quickly, so I have not tried this method. 
- Grayscale 
	- Supposed to make using your phone (especially consuming media) worse but still accessible
	- would probably work better if I could lock it (maybe using a physical screen filter or Family-Link-like tool)


### Task-based alarm clock
- use alarm app that forces you to perform a given task to dismiss it
- this can prevent oversleeping (especially for naps (see above))
- for me, the best part is preventing you from lying in bed excessively after waking (i strongly prefer the task of "scanning a barcode/QR code" for this reason)
- apps: Alarmy [Android + iOS], I Can't Wake Up! [Android] (allows multiple barcodes in free version), etc. 
	
### Melatonin as a way to sleep (*not nap*) earlier than usual (without relying on lots of self-discipline)
- üö©melatonin 0.5-1 hr before desired sleep time 
- Begin dosing at <0.5 mg. May cause excess drowsiness in some people (myself included) the following day, especially during naps. 

## Conclusion
I don't have much experience with most of these, so take it for what it's worth. I recommend trying the lowest-effort strategies first since they may have a higher ROI (since the "I" is smaller in the "ROI").
