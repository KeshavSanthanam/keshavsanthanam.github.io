Why business owners actually sell—and how it shapes deal dynamics:

## Common Seller Narratives vs Reality

**"I want to retire"**
- Often true, but nuanced: retire from what exactly?
- Owner tired of day-to-day but loves the business
- vs owner truly ready to walk away completely
- Ask: What will you do after selling? (Vague answer = may not be ready)

**"Business has so much potential"**
- Translation: I haven't captured it, maybe you can
- Either they lack skills/capital/motivation, or potential isn't real
- Ask: What's stopping you from capturing it? (Usually reveals the real constraint)

**"Family doesn't want the business"**
- Increasingly common (kids don't want to run landscaping company)
- Can be great opportunity if business is solid
- But ask: Why don't they want it? (If it's a lifestyle/margin issue, that's your problem now)

**"Health issues"**
- Often legitimate, creates urgency
- Risk: Has health issue affected business operations?
- Opportunity: Less price negotiation if they need to move quickly

## The Actual Motivations I'm Learning to Identify

**Burned Out**
- Working 60+ hours/week for years
- Lifestyle unsustainable but business is fine
- Good target: You bring fresh energy and systems to reduce hours
- Red flag: If burnout is due to unsolvable customer/employee problems

**Business Declining**
- Industry headwinds, losing market share, margin compression
- Seller won't say this directly—shows up in financials
- Can be opportunity if decline is fixable (bad management vs structural)
- Usually not: Get the business cheap but can't stop the bleeding

**Major Life Event**
- Divorce, death in family, relocation, new opportunity
- Creates real urgency without business being broken
- Often best deals: Seller motivated, business healthy
- Timing matters: Be ready to move quickly

**Transition to Next Chapter**
- Sold previous business, tried this one, ready for something else
- Often younger sellers (40s-50s) who are serial entrepreneurs
- Good: They're rational, deal-savvy, professional
- Bad: They're rational, deal-savvy, professional (harder to negotiate)

**Cash Out**
- Built valuable business, wants liquidity
- Rare in small businesses (usually just take distributions)
- More common: Needs cash for something specific (kid's college, medical, new investment)

## How Motivation Affects Deal Terms

**Retire/Burned Out Sellers**
- Often willing to stay for 30-90 day transition, not longer
- Less likely to hold seller note (want clean exit)
- May accept lower price for certainty of close
- Emotional about legacy—care how you'll treat employees/customers

**Distressed Sellers**
- Maximum leverage for buyer, but highest risk
- Will take creative structures (earnouts, seller notes, consulting)
- Price negotiable, but are you buying a problem?

**Sophisticated Sellers**
- Know their EBITDA, multiples, comparable sales
- Less room for "deal of a century" pricing
- Cleaner process: Good financials, organized data room
- Faster close if you're prepared and professional

**Family/Lifestyle Sellers**
- Care deeply about "right buyer" (cultural fit, will you treat employees well?)
- Less price sensitive if they believe you'll steward business properly
- Often willing to be flexible on terms for right person
- Opportunity: Build relationship, demonstrate you care about legacy

## Questions to Uncover Real Motivation

- "What would make this the perfect outcome for you?"
- "What are you most worried about in selling?"
- "If we could structure this any way, what would be ideal?"
- "What would make you walk away from a deal?"
- "How are you thinking about your time post-sale?"

## Red Flags in Seller Behavior

**Overly Eager**
- Willing to accept way below asking without negotiation
- Pushing to close extremely fast
- What aren't they telling you?

**Overly Defensive**
- Can't explain financial discrepancies
- Dismissive of customer concentration risk
- Doesn't want you talking to employees or customers
- Probably hiding something material

**Can't Let Go**
- Wants to stay on as "advisor" indefinitely
- Second-guesses transition plans
- Emotionally attached but claims to want out
- Will make your life miserable post-close

**Lack of Organization**
- Can't produce basic financials
- No customer contracts or documentation
- Chaotic operations, no SOPs
- May be good business, but diligence will be painful and risky

## My Approach to Seller Conversations

**Build Relationship First**
- Understand their story: How'd they build the business?
- What are they proud of?
- What's been hardest?
- Let them talk (they often reveal more than they intend)

**Align on Vision**
- Share what you admire about their business
- How you'd approach ownership (respect what works, improve what doesn't)
- Address their concerns proactively

**Be Honest About Fit**
- If you're not right buyer, say so (builds trust for future)
- If business isn't right for you, explain why
- Reputation matters in small search community

## Key Insight

The best deals come from motivated sellers with good businesses, not desperate sellers with broken ones. Understand what they really want (money, legacy, speed, certainty, peace of mind) and structure around that. Price is one variable—terms, timing, cultural fit, and post-sale involvement often matter more to sellers than pure dollars.
