## Common Seller Narratives

**"I want to retire"**
- Often true
- Owner tired of day-to-day but loves the business
	- vs owner truly ready to walk away completely
- Ask: What will you do after selling? (Vague answer = may not be ready)

**"Business has so much potential"**
- Translation: I haven't captured it, maybe you can
- Either they lack skills/capital/motivation, or potential isn't real
- Ask: What's stopping you from capturing it? (Usually reveals the real constraint)

**"Family doesn't want the business"**
- Can be great opportunity if business is solid
- But ask: Why don't they want it? (If it's a lifestyle/margin issue, that's your problem now)

**"Health issues"**
- Often legitimate, creates urgency
- Risk: Has health issue affected business operations?

## The Actual Motivations I'm Learning to Identify

**Burned Out**
- Working 60+ hours/week for years

**Business Declining**
- Industry headwinds, losing market share, margin compression

**Major Life Event**
- Be ready to move quickly

**Transition to Next Chapter**
- Sold previous business, tried this one, ready for something else
- Often younger sellers (40s-50s) who are serial entrepreneurs

**Cash Out**
- Built valuable business, wants liquidity
- Rare in small businesses (usually just take distributions)

## How Motivation Affects Deal Terms

**Retire/Burned Out Sellers**
- Often willing to stay for 30-90 day transition, not longer
- Less likely to hold seller note (want clean exit)

**Distressed Sellers**
- Maximum leverage for buyer, but highest risk
- Will take creative structures (earnouts, seller notes, consulting)
- Price negotiable, but are you buying a problem?

**Sophisticated Sellers**
- Know their EBITDA, multiples, comparable sales
- Less room for "deal of a century" pricing
- Cleaner process: Good financials, organized data room
- Faster close if you're prepared and professional
