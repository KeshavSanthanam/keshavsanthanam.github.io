title: Working Capital in LOIs - The Hidden Price Adjustment

Working capital provisions can swing deal value by 20-30%. Here's what I'm learning:

## What Is Normal Working Capital (NWC)?
- Current assets minus current liabilities (excluding cash and debt)
- Typically: AR + Inventory - AP - Accrued Expenses
- "Normal" = average over past 12-24 months, adjusted for seasonality
- Seller delivers this level at close, or purchase price adjusts

## Why It Matters

**Scenario 1: Seller Delivers Less Than Normal WC**
- Business has $500K normal WC
- At close, only $350K actual WC (collected receivables, didn't restock inventory)
- Buyer pays $150K less, or seller funds the $150K difference
- Protects buyer from seller extracting working capital pre-close

**Scenario 2: Seasonal Business Complexity**
- Landscaping business: working capital spikes in spring/summer
- Purchase price adjustment needs to account for time of year
- Use normalized WC target, not point-in-time snapshot

## Common LOI Working Capital Structures

**Dollar Peg**
- "Seller to deliver $400K in working capital at close"
- Clear, simple, easy to calculate
- Requires agreement on what's "normal" upfront

**Floating Target**
- "Working capital to be delivered = average of prior 24 months"
- Calculated at close based on formula
- More flexible, less chance of gaming

**Range/Collar**
- "WC between $350-450K, no adjustment. Outside range = dollar-for-dollar adjustment"
- Reduces small adjustments and post-close disputes
- Common in deals <$5M where precision matters less

## Items I'm Learning to Negotiate

**Excluded from Working Capital**
- Cash (you're buying the business, not their cash reserves)
- Debt (handled separately in enterprise value calculation)
- Shareholder loans or related party receivables
- Often: prepaid expenses (depends on nature)

**Included (Usually)**
- Accounts receivable (at net realizable value)
- Inventory (at lower of cost or market)
- Accounts payable
- Accrued expenses (payroll, taxes, etc.)

## Seller Games to Watch

**Aggressive Collections Pre-Close**
- Offering steep discounts to collect AR quickly
- Damages customer relationships
- Leaves you with slow-paying customers only
- Mitigation: collar/cap on how much AR can decline

**Inventory Depletion**
- Running down inventory to generate cash
- You inherit empty shelves and backorders
- Mitigation: minimum inventory levels in LOI

**Stretching Payables**
- Delaying payments to suppliers beyond terms
- You inherit angry vendors and damaged relationships
- Mitigation: specify that AP should be within terms

## Buyer Protections in LOI

- Define working capital components specifically
- Set target based on historical average (show your math)
- Require monthly WC reporting between LOI and close
- Right to object to unusual changes in AR/AP/Inventory
- Post-close adjustment mechanism (usually within 30-90 days)
- Escrow or holdback for disputed amounts

## Real Example I'm Studying

$3M purchase price, $450K normal working capital:
- At close audit: $380K actual WC delivered
- Shortfall: $70K
- Adjustment: Buyer pays $2.93M instead of $3M, or
- Seller wires $70K to business after close

## Key Takeaway
Working capital is not part of the purchase price—it's what you need to operate the business day one. Seller shouldn't get to extract it before handing you the keys. Define it clearly in LOI, monitor it during diligence, and adjust at close.
