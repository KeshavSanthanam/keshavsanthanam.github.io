Three weeks into systematic outreach—here's what I'm learning:

## The Broker Reality
- 80% of listed deals are overpriced or misrepresented
- "Motivated seller" usually means motivated to get asking price
- Best use of broker relationships: understanding what sells, not expecting hidden gems
- Good for market education, not for finding great deals
- Seeing same recycled listings across BizBuySell, Axial, others

## Direct Outreach Hit Rates
- Cold email response rate: ~3-5% (expected this)
- Positive responses from ~0.5% so far
- Most replies are "not interested" or "maybe in 3-5 years"
- Quality of conversation > quantity of contacts
- Takes 3-4 touches before owners engage seriously

## Where I'm Seeing More Openness
- Business owners I get introduced to through intermediaries
- Accountants and lawyers as referral sources (slow burn relationship building)
- Industry trade groups and associations
- Owners who've been through an exit before (they get the process)

## Channel Breakdown (Time vs Results)

**Brokers/Marketplaces: 20% time, 5% viable opportunities**
- Good for staying sharp on valuation
- Understanding market dynamics
- Practice analyzing deals quickly

**Direct Outreach: 40% time, 25% viable opportunities**
- Building target company lists
- Researching owners and businesses
- Personalized outreach campaigns
- Lower hit rate but better quality

**Network/Referrals: 40% time, 70% viable opportunities**
- Coffees with accountants, lawyers, other searchers
- Industry events (surprisingly useful)
- Introductions through mutual connections
- Takes months to build, but highest conversion

## Adjusting My Approach
- Shifting from spray-and-pray cold outreach to warmer introductions
- Investing more time in 10-15 high-potential relationships vs 100 cold emails
- Looking for "proprietary deal flow" is overrated—focus on being first call when someone's ready
- Playing long game: staying in touch with owners who aren't ready yet

## Metrics I'm Tracking
- New owner conversations per week: targeting 5-7
- Second conversations (signal of serious interest): targeting 2-3
- LOI-worthy opportunities per quarter: hoping for 1-2
- Time from first contact to serious conversation: averaging 6-8 weeks

Not glamorous, but this is the grind.
