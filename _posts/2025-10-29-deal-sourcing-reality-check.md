## The Broker Reality
- 80% of listed deals are overpriced or misrepresented
- "Motivated seller" usually means motivated to get asking price
- Best use of broker relationships: understanding what sells, not expecting hidden gems
- Seeing same recycled listings across BizBuySell, Axial, others

## Better Opportunities
- Business owners I get introduced to through intermediaries
- Accountants and lawyers as referral sources
- Industry trade groups and associations
- Owners who've been through an exit before (guidance mainly)

## Channel Breakdown (My Estimates)

**Brokers/Marketplaces: 20% time, 5% viable opportunities**
- Good for staying sharp on valuation
- Understanding market dynamics
- Practice analyzing deals quickly

**Direct Outreach: 40% time, 25% viable opportunities**
- Building target company lists
- Researching owners and businesses
- Personalized outreach campaigns

**Network/Referrals: 40% time, 70% viable opportunities**
- Coffees with accountants, lawyers, other searchers
- Introductions through mutual connections
- Focus on being first call when someone's ready
- Playing the long game: staying in touch with owners who aren't ready yet

## Metrics I'm Tracking
- New owner conversations per week: targeting 5-7
- Second conversations (signal of serious interest): targeting 2-3
- LOI-worthy opportunities per quarter: hoping for 1-2
- Time from first contact to serious conversation: averaging 6-8 weeks
