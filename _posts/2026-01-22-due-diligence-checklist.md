Systematizing the investigation phase between LOI and close:

## Phase 1: Financial Due Diligence (Weeks 1-3)

**Tax Returns vs Financial Statements**
- Compare seller-prepared financials to tax returns (always differences—how big?)
- Reconcile revenue: cash vs accrual, timing differences
- Understand add-backs: Are they legitimate or aggressive?

**Quality of Earnings (QofE)**
- Revenue sustainability: recurring vs one-time, customer concentration
- Expense normalization: what's truly recurring?
- Working capital analysis: normal vs current levels
- For deals >$2M, consider hiring QofE firm ($15-30K)

**Customer Analysis**
- Top 20 customers: revenue, tenure, concentration risk
- Cohort analysis: retention rates by vintage
- Contract review: Terms, length, cancellation provisions
- Revenue by customer type/segment

**Historical Performance**
- 3-5 years of P&L trends
- Same-store/organic growth vs acquisitions
- Seasonality patterns
- Margin evolution (gross and operating)

## Phase 2: Operational Due Diligence (Weeks 2-4)

**Operations Deep Dive**
- Shadow key employees and understand workflows
- Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
- Document standard operating procedures (or lack thereof)
- Understand capacity: Can we grow without major CapEx?

**People and Organization**
- Org chart: Who actually does what?
- Compensation analysis: market rates, retention risk
- Key person dependency: What happens if GM quits?
- Employee sentiment (if you can gauge it)
- Any HR liabilities: lawsuits, worker's comp claims

**Technology and Systems**
- What software/systems are critical?
- Are licenses transferable?
- Technical debt or upcoming required upgrades?
- Data security and backups

**Facilities and Equipment**
- Lease terms and transferability
- Condition of equipment (CapEx needs?)
- Deferred maintenance backlog
- Environmental issues (if manufacturing/industrial)

## Phase 3: Legal and Compliance (Weeks 2-4)

**Corporate and Contracts**
- Contracts: Customer, vendor, lease, employment
- Intellectual property: Trademarks, patents, domain names
- Litigation history: Current or threatened lawsuits
- Licenses and permits: Transferability

**Compliance**
- Regulatory compliance (industry-specific)
- Tax compliance: Payroll taxes, sales tax, property tax
- Insurance: Coverage, claims history, transferability
- Environmental (if applicable): EPA, state regulations

**Transaction Structure**
- Asset vs stock purchase (tax implications)
- Liabilities being assumed
- Escrow and holdback provisions
- Reps and warranties

## Phase 4: Commercial Due Diligence (Weeks 3-5)

**Market and Competition**
- Industry growth trends
- Competitive landscape: Who are we competing with?
- Market share and positioning
- Barriers to entry and competitive moats

**Customer Calls (Critical)**
- Talk to top 10-15 customers (with seller introduction)
- Understand why they buy, what they value
- Gauge reaction to ownership change
- Identify at-risk relationships

**Vendor Relationships**
- Key supplier dependencies
- Contract terms and pricing
- Availability of alternative suppliers
- Pending price increases or changes

**Sales and Marketing**
- Lead generation: Where do customers come from?
- Sales process: How do we close deals?
- Marketing spend and effectiveness
- CAC and LTV economics

## Red Flags That Would Make Me Walk

**Financial Red Flags**

- Customer concentration >40% in top 3 customers
- Gross margins declining (pricing pressure indicator)
- Unexplained cash vs accrual differences
- Aging receivables >90 days exceeds 15% of total AR

**Operational Red Flags**
- Key person dependency with no succession plan
- Outdated technology that requires major investment
- Deferred maintenance that will hit P&L immediately
- Regulatory compliance issues

**Legal Red Flags**
- Pending litigation that could be material
- IP not properly owned by the business
- Environmental liabilities
- Tax liens or unresolved tax issues

**Commercial Red Flags**
- Can't articulate why customers buy from them
- Industry in structural decline
- Customers leaving or reducing spend
- Losing bids to competition on price (no differentiation)

## Key Insight

Due diligence is not about finding reasons to kill the deal—it's about understanding what you're buying and confirming assumptions from LOI. Most deals have issues; question is whether they're fixable or fatal. Use DD to adjust price/terms (if appropriate) and build integration plan. If you find too many surprises, that's a signal to walk—but expect some surprises in every deal.
