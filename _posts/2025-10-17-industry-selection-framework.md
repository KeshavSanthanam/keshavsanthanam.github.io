Narrowing down from "all businesses" to targetable industries:

## My Current Screening Criteria

**Fragmentation**
- Industries with <20% market share by top 3 players
	- Indicates room for regional players to thrive
- Less risk of being squeezed by national consolidators
- Examples: specialized manufacturing, regional distribution, niche services

**Recession Resistance**
- Revenue didn't drop >25% in 2008-2009 or 2020
- Preferably maintained margins during downturns
- Not looking for recession-proof, just resilient
- B2B services with high switching costs score well here

**Minimum Viable Scale**
- Can a $3-5M revenue business support professional management?
- Gross margins >30% preferred to cover overhead
- Not so capital intensive that all cash flow goes to maintenance capex
- Service businesses with 40-50% margins give more room for error

## Industries I'm Deprioritizing

**High Customer Concentration**
- Top 3 customers are more than 50% revenue
- Government contractors with single agency dependency
- Supplier businesses tied to one major manufacturer

**Massive Technological Disruption**
- Print media, traditional advertising
- Anything getting clearly replaced by software
- However: boring tech-enabled businesses (route optimization software for waste hauling) can be interesting

**Extreme Regulatory Burden**
- Healthcare providers navigating insurance networks (too complex for first-time operator)
- Food manufacturing (Compliance)
- However, an established businesses with compliance already figured out could work

## Industries Moving Up My List

1. **Specialty Distribution** - chemicals, industrial supplies, niche components
2. **Commercial Services** - facility maintenance, specialized cleaning, testing/inspection
3. **Light Manufacturing** - job shops, contract manufacturing with diverse customer base
4. **Software-Adjacent Services** - implementation, integration, managed services for vertical software

## What I'm Learning

- Industry matters less than business quality and my ability to add value
- Should narrow to 3-5 industries and research them cyclically
- Find ways to talk to operators
