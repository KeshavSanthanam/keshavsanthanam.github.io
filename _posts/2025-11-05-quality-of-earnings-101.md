QofE analysis separates real earnings from accounting narratives:

## Core Purpose
- Validate seller's represented EBITDA/SDE
- Identify non-recurring revenue or one-time expenses
- Understand true economic earnings power
- Flag accounting aggressiveness or irregularities

## Revenue Quality Questions

**Sustainability**
- Is revenue growing, flat, or declining by customer cohort?
- What % comes from customers >3 years old vs new customers?
- Any concentration risk? (Top 10 customers = what % of revenue?)
- Contractual/recurring vs project-based revenue mix

**One-Time Items to Adjust Out**
- Large project revenue that won't recur
- Revenue from divested product lines
- Contract termination fees or settlements
- COVID-related government subsidies

## Expense Adjustments

**Items to Add Back (Increase Earnings)**
- One-time legal/consulting fees
- Non-recurring severance or restructuring costs
- Owner's above-market compensation
- Personal expenses run through business
- Excess rent to related party

**Items to Add In (Decrease Earnings)**
- Deferred maintenance catching up with you
- Below-market owner salary if you'll need to hire replacement
- Understated bad debt reserves
- Benefits/perks that can't be cut without causing turnover

## Working Capital Deep Dive
- Are receivables actually collectible? (Aging analysis critical)
- Inventory obsolescence—selling old inventory inflates current year cash
- Payables stretched beyond terms = unsustainable
- Seasonal working capital needs

## Red Flags That Make Me Pause

**Accounting Red Flags**
- Revenue recognition changes year-over-year
- Frequent restatements or adjustments
- Related party transactions without clear documentation
- Inventory valuation changes

**Operational Red Flags**
- Customer concentration increasing over time
- Gross margins declining while revenue grows (pricing pressure)
- Rising DSO (days sales outstanding)—customers paying slower
- CapEx well below depreciation for multiple years (deferred maintenance)

## Small Business Specific Issues
- Cash vs accrual accounting (need to normalize)
- Owner commingling personal and business expenses
- Informal employment arrangements (family members, 1099 workers)
- Revenue timing games near year-end

## My Practical Approach
- First pass: recreate P&L from bank statements and tax returns
- Compare seller representation to tax returns (always differences, but how big?)
- Customer analysis: top 20 customers, revenue trends, concentration
- Talk to accountant (if they'll speak with you)
- For anything >$2M, worth hiring QofE firm ($15-25K typically)

## Key Insight
Real earnings usually 10-30% below seller representation for small businesses. Not fraud—just different perspectives on adjustments. A good QofE process aligns buyer and seller on realistic earnings before LOI, avoiding painful retrading later.
