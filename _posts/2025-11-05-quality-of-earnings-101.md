## Core Purpose
- Validate seller's represented EBITDA/SDE
- Identify non-recurring revenue or one-time expenses
- Flag accounting irregularities

## Revenue Quality Questions

**Sustainability**
- Is revenue growing, flat, or declining by customer cohort?
- Find percentages of customers that are:
	- 1 year old
	- 3 years old
	- 10 years old...
- Contractual/recurring revenue is best

**One-Time Items to Adjust Out**
- Large project revenue that won't recur
- Revenue from divested product lines
- Contract termination fees or settlements
- Short-term government subsidies including lending (i.e. COVID PPP)

## Expense Adjustments

**Items to Add Back (Increase Earnings)**
- One-time legal/consulting fees
- Non-recurring severance or restructuring costs
- Excess rent to property owner (favoritism basically)

**Items to Add In (Decrease Earnings)**
- Deferred maintenance catching up with you
- Below-market owner salary if you'll need to hire replacement
- Understated bad debt reserves
- Working capital that's too low

## Working Capital Deep Dive
- Are receivables actually collectible? Find your Net-X
- Inventory obsolescence
	- Selling old inventory inflates the current year's revenue
- Payables stretched beyond terms
- Seasonal working capital needs

## Red Flags

**Accounting Red Flags**
- Revenue recognition changes year-over-year
- Frequent restatements or adjustments
- Inventory valuation changes

**Operational Red Flags**
- Customer concentration increasing over time
- Gross margins declining while revenue grows (pricing pressure)
- Rising DSO (days sales outstanding)
- CapEx well below depreciation for multiple years (deferred maintenance)

## Small Business Specific Issues
- Cash vs accrual accounting (need to normalize)
- Informal employment arrangements (wrongful classification of 1099 workers)
- Revenue timing games near year-end

## My Practical Approach
- First pass: recreate P&L from bank statements and tax returns
- Compare seller representation to tax returns
- Customer analysis: top 20 customers, revenue trends, concentration
- Talk to _their_ accountant
- Worth hiring QofE firm ($15-25K typically)

## Key Insight
Real earnings usually 10-30% below seller representation for small businesses. A good QofE process aligns buyer and seller on realistic earnings before LOI, mitigating the risk of the deal falling apart.
