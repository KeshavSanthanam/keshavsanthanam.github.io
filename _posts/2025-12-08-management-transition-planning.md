The 100-day plan before and after acquisition close:

## Pre-Close Transition Planning (Days -60 to 0)

**Information Gathering**
- Document all standard operating procedures (or lack thereof)
- Map key customer relationships and ownership
- Identify critical vendor relationships and terms
- Understand employee roles, comp, and institutional knowledge
- Where are the passwords, literally?

**Relationship Building**
- Shadow seller in customer meetings (if possible, pre-close)
- Meet key employees informally (coffee, lunch)
- Understand company culture and unwritten rules
- Identify who the real influencers are (not just titles)

**Alignment with Seller**
- Agree on announcement strategy (employees, customers, vendors)
- Transition services agreement (TSA) scope and duration
- Seller's ongoing role (if any): advisor, consultant, equity holder?

## First 30 Days Post-Close

**Do Not:**
- Announce grand strategic vision without understanding current state
- Fire or promote people without deep understanding
- Renegotiate customer/vendor contracts aggressively

**Do:**
- Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- 1-on-1s with every employee (what's working, what's not, what would they change)
- Shadow different roles (sales calls, ops floor, customer service)
- Understand current metrics and reporting (even if imperfect)
- Quick wins: fix obvious broken processes, clean up workspace, invest in morale

**Key Questions to Answer**
- Where does the money actually come from? (not what CRM says, but reality)
- What would cause customers to leave?
- What would cause key employees to leave?
- What's the biggest operational bottleneck?
- What metrics actually matter vs vanity metrics?

## Days 31-60: Stabilize

**Priorities**
- Confirm or adjust comp structure for key employees
- Install basic financial reporting if missing (weekly cash, monthly P&L)
- Identify and prioritize top 3-5 operational improvements
- Build trust with customers (calls, visits, reassurance)
- Establish your management rhythm (weekly team meeting, monthly reviews)

**Common Pitfalls I'm Trying to Avoid**
- Underestimating resistance to change among key employees
- Moving too fast and spooking customers
- Waiting for perfect information before any decision

## Days 61-100: Initial Improvements

**By Day 100, Goal Is:**
- Stable revenue (not declining due to transition)
- No key employee departures (or backfilled if unavoidable)
- 1-2 operational improvements implemented
- Clear understanding of where value will be created in year 1
- Financial reporting and metrics in place to track progress

**Typical Early Wins**
- Pricing optimization (small businesses often underpriced)
- Accounts receivable collection (tighten credit terms, follow up faster)
- Vendor renegotiation (better terms, consolidate suppliers)
- Marketing/sales: try new sources
- Basic process documentation (reduces key person risk)

## Key Metrics to Track During Transition

- Revenue retention by customer (especially top 20)
- Employee turnover
- Gross margin (early indicator if something's breaking)
- Customer acquisition
- Accounts receivable aging
