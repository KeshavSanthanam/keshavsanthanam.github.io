The 100-day plan before and after acquisition close:

## Pre-Close Transition Planning (Days -60 to 0)

**Information Gathering**
- Document all standard operating procedures (or lack thereof)
- Map key customer relationships and ownership
- Identify critical vendor relationships and terms
- Understand employee roles, comp, and institutional knowledge
- Where are the passwords, literally?

**Relationship Building**
- Shadow seller in customer meetings (if possible pre-close)
- Meet key employees informally (coffee, lunch)
- Understand company culture and unwritten rules
- Identify who the real influencers are (not just titles)

**Alignment with Seller**
- Agree on announcement strategy (employees, customers, vendors)
- Transition services agreement (TSA) scope and duration
- Seller's ongoing role (if any): advisor, consultant, equity holder?
- What's motivating the seller? (Retirement, health, burnout, new opportunity)

## First 30 Days Post-Close

**Do Not:**
- Change everything at once
- Announce grand strategic vision without understanding current state
- Fire or promote people without deep understanding
- Renegotiate customer/vendor contracts aggressively

**Do:**
- Listen more than you talk (80/20 rule)
- 1-on-1s with every employee (what's working, what's not, what would they change)
- Shadow different roles (sales calls, ops floor, customer service)
- Understand current metrics and reporting (even if imperfect)
- Quick wins: fix obvious broken processes, clean up workspace, invest in morale

**Key Questions to Answer**
- Where does the money actually come from? (not what CRM says, but reality)
- What would cause customers to leave?
- What would cause key employees to leave?
- What's the biggest operational bottleneck?
- What metrics actually matter vs vanity metrics?

## Days 31-60: Stabilize

**Priorities**
- Confirm or adjust comp structure for key employees
- Install basic financial reporting if missing (weekly cash, monthly P&L)
- Identify and prioritize top 3-5 operational improvements
- Build trust with customers (calls, visits, reassurance)
- Establish your management rhythm (weekly team meeting, monthly reviews)

**Common Pitfalls I'm Trying to Avoid**
- Implementing systems from your last job that don't fit this business
- Underestimating how much tribal knowledge lives in people's heads
- Moving too fast and spooking customers or employees
- Analysis paralysis: waiting for perfect information before any decision

## Days 61-100: Initial Improvements

**By Day 100, Goal Is:**
- Stable revenue (not declining due to transition)
- No key employee departures (or backfilled if unavoidable)
- 1-2 operational improvements implemented (not planned—actually done)
- Clear understanding of where value will be created in year 1
- Financial reporting and metrics in place to track progress

**Typical Early Wins**
- Pricing optimization (small businesses often underpriced)
- Accounts receivable collection (tighten credit terms, follow up faster)
- Vendor renegotiation (better terms, consolidate suppliers)
- Marketing/sales: systematize what owner did intuitively
- Basic process documentation (reduces key person risk)

## Seller Transition Models

**Clean Break (Seller Leaves at Close)**
- Pros: Clear ownership, forces institutional knowledge capture
- Cons: Risky if business highly dependent on seller relationships
- Works best: Systems-driven businesses, seller burned out or difficult

**Short Transition (30-90 Days)**
- Seller available for questions, introductions, training
- Typically paid via consulting agreement ($5-15K/month)
- Most common structure for main street businesses

**Long Transition (6-12 Months)**
- Seller stays in reduced role (part-time, advisory)
- Good for relationship-heavy businesses (insurance, professional services)
- Risk: Seller can't let go, undermines new owner authority

**Ongoing (Seller Stays as Employee)**
- Rare and usually problematic
- Only works if clear role definition and seller truly willing to be IC not CEO
- Watch for: seller second-guessing, employees confused about who's in charge

## Key Metrics to Track During Transition

- Revenue retention by customer (especially top 20)
- Employee turnover (especially key roles)
- Gross margin (early indicator if something's breaking)
- Customer acquisition (are we still winning new business?)
- Accounts receivable aging (are customers still paying?)

## My Current Thinking

The first 100 days are about earning the right to lead, not proving you're smart. Show respect for what's been built, understand before changing, and build trust before making big moves. Small businesses often fail post-acquisition not because the buyer's strategy was wrong, but because they lost key customers or employees during a chaotic transition.
